        "ground_truth": "`__str__` is used for informal, user-friendly string representation (called by str() and print()). "
                        "`__repr__` is used for official, unambiguous representation (called by repr() and should be valid Python code if possible)."

    # "question": "Explain how Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) affects multithreading.",
    # "ground_truth": "The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. "
    #                 "This makes true CPU-bound parallelism difficult with threads, which is why multiprocessing is often preferred for CPU-heavy tasks."
